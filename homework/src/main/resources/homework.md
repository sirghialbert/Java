# Final Project

Beforehand you should create a branch using the team name and the homework module should be used.

We thought that it would be nice to put together all the information that you have gathered since DevSchool started.
Your target is to build an application from scratch which will contain backend implementation. The idea is to build our Bank, which should have the following features:

### The user should:
-  Have the possibility to login / logout â€“ Use Spring Security and the password should not be saved in plaintext
-  Be able to have multiple accounts in different currencies
-  Be able to see the available balance for all the accounts
-  Be able to exchange money from a currency to another (hardcoded exchange rate)
-  Be able to make a transaction to another user
-  Be able to request money from another user
-  Be able to see the transactions history (income/ outcome)

### Transaction:
-  An operation of money transfer between two accounts
-  After the transaction is executed, the balance is updated accordingly for both accounts

### Bonus
1. Use an HTTP Client (Rest Template) to call an external api to fetch the exchange rate.
2. Create unit tests for services.

You have to think of a way to design the database and apis. Feel free to create/add any validation you like in backend. You should prepare also a postman collection which will contain all your created endpoints.
